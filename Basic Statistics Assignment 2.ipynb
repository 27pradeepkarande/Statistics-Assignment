    "14. How do outliers affect measures of central tendency and dispersion? Provide an example\n",
    "ans :- Outliers can have a significant impact on measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode) and dispersion\n",
    "       (range, variance, and standard deviation). Here's how outliers can affect these measures, along with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Mean:\n",
    "   - Effect: Outliers can heavily influence the mean, pulling it toward extreme values. A single very large or very small \n",
    "             observation can skew the mean in the direction of the outlier.\n",
    "   - Example: Consider the following dataset: 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 100. The mean without the outlier is 16.4, but with \n",
    "              the outlier, it becomes 28.8.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Median:\n",
    "   - Effect: The median is less affected by outliers than the mean. Outliers don't influence the median as much because it is not\n",
    "             based on the actual values but on their order.\n",
    "   - Example: Using the same dataset, the median is 17 without the outlier and remains the same even with the outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Mode:\n",
    "   - Effect: Like the median, the mode is resistant to the influence of outliers because it is based on frequencies rather than the\n",
    "             values themselves.\n",
    "   - Example: The mode of the dataset is 16, and it remains 16 even with the outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Range:\n",
    "   - Effect: Outliers can greatly affect the range, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. The range \n",
    "             can become disproportionately large due to outliers.\n",
    "   - Example: In the dataset mentioned earlier, the range without the outlier is 12, but with the outlier, it becomes 90.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    5. Variance and Standard Deviation:\n",
    "   - Effect: Outliers can significantly impact variance and standard deviation since these measures are sensitive to the distances\n",
    "             between individual data points and the mean.\n",
    "   - Example: Without the outlier, the variance is 20.44, but with the outlier, it increases to 778.4. The standard deviation also\n",
    "              shows a substantial increase.\n",
    "    \n",
    "     It's important to be aware of the potential impact of outliers on statistical measures. Depending on the context and the goals\n",
    "    of your analysis, you may choose to handle outliers by removing them or using robust statistical measures that are less sensitive to extreme values."
